# liquidGL – Ultra-light glassmorphism for the web

> [!TIP]
> Building a native Kotlin/Jetpack Compose app? Use the new
> [`liquidglass-compose`](ANDROID_KOTLIN.md) Android library. It uses native Compose drawing and
> Android `RuntimeShader`—there is no JavaScript or WebView.

**v2.0.2**

> [!NOTE]
> `liquidGL` is now available on npm: `npm install liquid-gl`. The `package/` directory contains the npm package source and is not required when using the CDN/browser script.

> [!WARNING]
> **v2.0.1 changed snapshot capture.** `liquidGL` now snapshots the page with its own built-in rasteriser, so `html2canvas` is no longer a dependency. Remove the `html2canvas` script tag from your page; no other changes are required.

>
> **v2.0.0 changed tilt behaviour.** The tilt interaction now eases symmetrically over the new `tiltEase` option (default `400`ms) in both directions, replacing the previous hard-coded `0.12s` ease-in and `0.4s` ease-out. If you depended on the old timing, set `tiltEase` explicitly. All other defaults are unchanged and existing configurations render identically.

`liquidGL` turns any fixed or sticky-positioned element into a perfectly refracted, glossy "glass pane" rendered in WebGL.

## What's New

**Features**

- **Sticky positioning support** — `position: sticky` elements can now be glassified. Sticky lenses are measured every animation frame, so the glass pane tracks the element through its flowing and stuck phases, then releases with it at the end of its containing block — inside nested scroll containers as well as the main document.

- **Built-in DOM snapshotter** — the `html2canvas` dependency has been replaced with an integrated rasteriser. There is one less script to load, and capture no longer depends on a third-party library.

- **Chromatic aberration** — the new `aberration` option disperses the red and blue channels either side of the refraction vector, blue displaced further than red, matching the way real glass disperses shorter wavelengths more strongly. Dispersion scales with the refraction offset, so it concentrates at the bevelled edge and vanishes at the flat centre. Defaults to `0` (off).

- **Configurable tilt easing** — the new `tiltEase` option sets the settle duration, in milliseconds, of the tilt on both hover-in and hover-out.

---

**Bug fixes**

- **Refraction drift caused by ignored elements** — elements marked `data-liquid-ignore` were removed from the snapshot entirely, collapsing them out of layout and shifting every element below them. Ignored elements now retain their layout box, so the refraction stays aligned with the live page.

- **Lens and content diverging during tilt** — the pane could separate from its content mid-tilt because the element was being measured while transformed. Metrics are now taken from the untilted box.

- **Tilt snapping on hover** — the refraction jumped straight to its new angle on hover-in while easing on hover-out. Both directions now share a single curve and duration, and cursor movement during entry retargets the in-flight ease rather than snapping.

- **Displacement while pinch-zoomed** — the pane drifted diagonally away from its element when the page was pinch-zoomed, because `visualViewport` offsets were applied twice. Offset compensation is now correctly gated.

---

**Performance**

- Video frames are no longer re-composited or re-uploaded when neither the frame time nor the destination region has changed. Paused, ended and unmoved videos now cost nothing per frame.
- The snapshot bounding box is read once per frame and shared across every lens, instead of twice per lens per frame, removing repeated forced layout from the render loop.

## Overview

`liquidGL` recreates Apple's "Liquid Glass" aesthetic in the browser with an ultra-light WebGL shader. It turns any DOM element into a beautiful, refracting glass pane. To overcome WebGL's security limitations on reading live screen pixels, `liquidGL` uses an innovative offscreen rendering technique. This allows it to refract dynamic content like videos, text animations, and more in real-time, delivering a smooth and interactive experience.

## Prerequisites

Add the following script before you initialise `liquidGL()` (normally at the end of the `<body>`):

```html
<!-- liquidGL.js – the library itself -->
<script src="/scripts/liquidGL.js" defer></script>
```

> `liquidGL` has no runtime dependencies. The high-resolution snapshot of the page background that it refracts is produced by its own built-in rasteriser.

---

## Quick start

Set up your HTML structure first. You will have a `target` element that will receive the glass effect, and a child element for your content (excluded from glass effect).

```html
<!-- Example HTML structure -->
<body>
  <!-- Target (glassified) -->
  <div class="liquidGL">
    <!-- Content -->
    <div class="content">
      <img src="/example.svg" alt="Alt Text" />
      <p>This example text content will appear on top of the glass.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

> Make sure that your `target` element has a high z-index so that it sits over your page content. Any content with a higher z-index than the `target` will be excluded from the lens, i.e a modal video player that you don't want to stain the lens.

Next, initialise the library with the selector for your target element.

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    const glassEffect = liquidGL({
      snapshot: "body", // The area used for refraction, <body> recommended and default
      target: ".liquidGL", // CSS selector for the element(s) to glass-ify
      resolution: 2.0, // The quality of the snapshot
      refraction: 0.01, // Base refraction strength (0–1)
      aberration: 0, // Chromatic aberration strength (0–1). 0 = off
      bevelDepth: 0.08, // Intensity of the edge bevel (0–1)
      bevelWidth: 0.15, // Width of the bevel as a proportion of the element (0–1)
      frost: 0, // Subtle blur radius in px. 0 = crystal clear
      shadow: true, // Adds a soft drop-shadow under the pane
      specular: true, // Animated light highlights (slightly more GPU)
      reveal: "fade", // Reveal animation
      tilt: false, // Whether tilt on hover is enabled
      tiltFactor: 5, // If tilt is enabled, how much tilt
      tiltEase: 400, // Tilt settle duration in ms, on hover in and out
      magnify: 1, // Magnification of lens content
      on: {
        init(instance) {
          // The `init` callback fires once liquidGL has taken its snapshot
          // and rendered the first frame. It's the ideal place to hide or
          // prepare elements for reveal animations (e.g. with GSAP, ScrollTrigger)
          // because it ensures the content is visible to the snapshot before
          // you hide it from the user.
          console.log("liquidGL ready!", instance);
        },
      },
    });
  });
</script>
```

## Dynamic Rendering

`liquidGL` can refract dynamic content like animations in real-time. To make this work, you must "register" any dynamic elements that will intersect with your glass pane. This tells `liquidGL` to monitor them and update the texture when they change.

> **Note:** Videos are automatically detected and do not need to be registered.

Register dynamic elements _after_ initialising `liquidGL()` but _before_ calling `liquidGL.syncWith()` (if used). You can register elements using a CSS selector string or by passing an array of DOM elements.

```javascript
// After initialising liquidGL...
const glassEffect = liquidGL({
  target: ".liquidGL",
  // ... other options
});

// Register an element by its CSS selector
liquidGL.registerDynamic(".my-animated-element");

// Register multiple elements (e.g., from a GSAP SplitText animation)
const mySplitText = SplitText.create(".my-text", { type: "lines" });
liquidGL.registerDynamic(mySplitText.lines); // Pass the array of line elements
```

---

## Optionally sync with Smooth Scrolling Libraries

`liquidGL` includes a `syncWith()` helper to automatically integrate with popular smooth-scrolling libraries like Lenis and Locomotive Scroll. It handles the render loop synchronization for you.

> Simply call `liquidGL.syncWith()` after initialising `liquidGL`.

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // First, initialise liquidGL
    const glassEffect = liquidGL({
      target: ".liquidGL",
      // ... other options
    });

    // Sync with scrolling libraries. This auto-detects libraries like
    // Lenis or Locomotive Scroll and returns their instances if found.
    const { lenis, locomotiveScroll } = liquidGL.syncWith();

    // You can now use the 'lenis' or 'locomotiveScroll' instances if needed.
  });
</script>
```

> Make sure to include the scroll library scripts (e.g., Lenis, GSAP) before your main script. The `syncWith()` helper must be called **after** `liquidGL()` has been called.

| What is the correct way to use `liquidGL` with page animations?          | Lets say you have a preloader, above the fold intro animations and scroll animations on your page. You would:<br><br>1) set the `data-liquid-ignore` attribute on your preloader<br>2) animate your preloader and set up your initial animation states<br>3) then call `liquidGL();`<br>4) optionally, in the `on.init();` callback, you can run post snapshot scripts, such as animating the `target` element |
| Can I use `liquidGL` on multiple elements?                               | Yes, any element which has the class declared as your `target` will be glassified. Note **all elements must use the same `z-index`** due to shared canvas optimisations, if you use different `z-index` values for multiple targets, the highest value will be used by `liquidGL`.                                                                                                                             |
| Will the library exceed WebGL contexts or have other performance issues? | No, the library uses a shared canvas for all instances, we have tested up to 30 elements on one page and we were not able to cause performance problems or crashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Are there any animation limitations?                                     | It depends on what you're trying to do, rotation and scale are expensive CPU/GPU processes, additionally `shadow` `specular` and `tilt` should be used with care when you have lots of instances or complex animations as they can clog the render pipeline.                                                                                                                                                   |

## Important Notes

- For dynamic content to be refracted in real-time, you must register the element(s) with `liquidGL.registerDynamic()`. It is crucial to set the initial state of your animations **before** calling `liquidGL()` to ensure they are captured correctly.
- The library ignores `fixed` position elements, this is to prevent a known snapshotting bug on mobile browsers from surfacing which can prevent the snapshot from running. This is a safety net that shouldn't interfere with your use of the library.
- You can have multiple instances on one page **but they must share the same `z-index` value**. If you specify different `z-index` values, `liquidGL` will use the highest `z-index` for all elements with the `target` selector. This is because the effect uses a shared canvas to prevent WebGL context issues, there is no work around to this unfortunately.
- To improve performance on complex pages, you can snapshot a smaller, specific element like a background container instead of the whole page. Use the `snapshot` option with a CSS selector (e.g., `snapshot: '.my-background'`). This reduces texture memory and improves performance.
- The initial capture is asynchronous. Call `liquidGL()` inside a `DOMContentLoaded` or `load` handler to ensure content is available to the snapshot.
- Extremely long documents can exceed GPU texture limits, causing memory or performance issues. Consider segmenting very long pages (see source) or reducing the `resolution` parameter.
- The `shadow` and `tilt` effects create new stacking layers behind the `target` element. The `shadow` is placed at `z-index - 2` and the `tilt` helper canvas is placed at `z-index - 1`. Ensure your `z-index` values leave room for these layers to prevent clipping or overflow issues.
- As with all WebGL effects, any **image** content inside the `target` element must have permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers set to prevent CORS issues.

## Browser Support

The `liquidGL` library is compatible with all WebGL enabled browsers on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

> [!NOTE]  
> Performance varies between browsers, specifically Safari can be unstable when the liquid element(s) are more than 50% of the viewport width or height. Practical use issues are rare, but make sure to test on your target devices thoroughly.

| Browser        | Supported |
| :------------- | :-------: |
| Google Chrome  |    Yes    |
| Safari         |    Yes    |
| Firefox        |    Yes    |
| Microsoft Edge |    Yes    |

## Other

**Exclude elements**

> You can set elements to be ignored by the refraction using `data-liquid-ignore`. Add this attribute on the parent container of the element you wish to exclude.

**Content Visibility**

> It is recommended to use `z-index: 3;` on the content inside your target element to make it sit on top of the lens. You can also combine this with `mix-blend-mode: difference;` for better legibility.

**Border-radius**

> `liquidGL` automatically inherits the `border-radius` of the `target` element, ensuring the refraction respects rounded corners without any extra configuration. If you animate the `border-radius` of your `target` element i.e on scroll, the bevel will animate in real time to remain in sync.
